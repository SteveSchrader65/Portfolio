# Portfolio
Project to outline my resume and showcase my programming capabilities to potential employers, as well as a launching platform for future education projects. 

This is an in-progress project where I aim to include different HTML/CSS/JavaScript features written entirely by myself. 

At some future point I would like to convert the entire site to React, once I further develop my skills in that framework (at time of writing, I am a complete newbie !!).
