Project to outline my resume and showcase my programming capabilities to potential 
employers, all in one place. When launched, the site will also serve as a launch 
platform for future education projects - should I return to studies in the near 
future. 

This project could potentially be converted to React at a later stage, once I 
develop those skills further. 

All HTML, CSS and JavaScript has been written by Steve.
