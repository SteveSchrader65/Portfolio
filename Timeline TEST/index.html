            <p>
              In April, 1994, my time in local transport commenced when I started as a courier
              driver for Skippers Transport. Like most drivers I was an owner-operator delivering
              urgent parcels, envelopes, packages. and more. As an owner-driver, I was responsible
              for maintaining good client relations, my own run-sheets and log-books and tax
              records.

              Having operated as a de-facto stand-in two-way operator for some time, in October of
              1996 I took on a role as the AM Despatcher whilst with Skippers Transport. In this
              capacity, I would log-in drivers as they commenced for the day, and operated as
              bookings clerk and dispatcher until the full-time staff started work.

              In April of 2007, I returned to working as an owner-operator courier driver, this time

              A chance conversation mid-2009 led to me accepting an internal position as a full-time
              Fleet Controller working with Fasta Couriers. As part of Fasta's team of controllers,
              I would co-ordinate drivers and bookings across north and south city divisions with

              While still working as a fleet-controller, I began driving for Secure Document
              Destruction. This was a subsidiary of the Fasta group. In this role I would collect
              bins of documents for recycling, and deliver these to a processing plant located in
