        Hello and welcome to my online portfolio, where innovation meets know-how in the world of
        programming and web-development. I am excited to present a showcase of my skills and
        projects, developed over the past few years after making the life-altering decision to
        return to full-time studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hi !! I'm <span class="animateMe">S</span><span class="animateMe">t</span

        ><span class="animateMe">e</span> ...<br>
        Having worked numerous roles in the transport industry over a twenty-year period, I found
        that I had reached a cross-road in my life and looked to pursue an interest in computer
        programming which had been germinating - unfulfilled - since my teenage years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The COVID pandemic had not yet arrived when the decision was made to take-up studies again.
        So it could be said that your presenter today was one of the innovators at the forefront of
        the current generational change towards working remotely.
        <br>Personally, I think my role was mere circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This web-site was originally intended to serve merely as a launching platform for projects
        and assessments worked-on during my studies. However, I soon realized that I also needed
        some form of portfolio through which I could showcase my work and projects to potential
        employers and clients. And so I looked to re-design my site. I re-built it from the ground
        up, planning to let it grow and evolve as I learned new skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my journey, I have worked to hone my proficiency in various programming
        languages, frameworks and development tools. From crafting dynamic and responsive websites
        to developing robust database solutions and mobile applications, I trust that my portfolio
        reflects my adaptability and commitment to working on a diverse range of projects with your
        organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to this recent journey, I had twice attempted similar programming courses on a
        part-time basis. However for me - with a full-time job and attending evening classes, as
        well as trying to find the time to study and complete assessments - there simply were not
        enough hours in any given week. I needed to be able to dedicate myself 100% !!
        <br>Then ... early in 2019 an opportunity arose ... and so I took it.

      <p class="course-info" id="course1">
        Beginning with the CertIV in Programming in June, 2019, we learned of basic programming
        structures using Java, and were introduced to Object-Oriented Programming concepts and
        principles. Database programming with SQL Server was the core of one unit, introducing CRUD
        operations. During another unit I created my first Unity game. Due to restrictions caused by
        the pandemic, it took until the end of 2020 to complete this course.
      </p>
      <p class="course-info" id="course2">
        Next I looked to the CertIV in Web Development to address my complete lack of knowledge in
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this course I was to learn the Python programming language; it
        also exposed me to SEO and its' relationship with e-commerce, as well as providing a solid
        basis in cyber-security and ethical business practices. My second Certificate-level
        qualification was completed in the middle of 2022 and I next had to decide if I wished to
        pursue a Programming stream, or further explore the Web Development branch.
      </p>
      <p class="course-info" id="course3">
        Believing that programming had the potential to open up more career opportunities, in 2022 I
        began the Diploma of Advanced Programming. This new diploma course was heavily
        programming-intensive, covering more studies with PHP and database programming in Laravel
        and MongoDB. There were further units in Python, as well as IoT programming (even more
        Python!!). Data Analysis formed a core part of the second semester where we were introduced
        to PowerBI, and Python packages, such as numpy and pandas. However, we were to spend the
        majority of this second semester with Dart and Flutter, working on our final group project -
        a mobile application.
      </p>
      <p id="outro">
        Since ending formal studies, I have aimed to further my knowledge with online tutorials and
        courses in HTML/CSS and JavaScript frameworks such as React and TypeScript. Indeed, this
        website was created from scratch using learned skills and (where necessary) researching
        features that I wished to incorporate. (My current plan is to re-do this site in React, once
        I gain more proficiency with that JavaScript framework.) At time of writing, it is my
        intention to enrol in the Diploma of Web Development in 2024.

    <div class="text_block" id="block3">
      <p>
        I am looking to launch my IT career in Programming and/or Web-Development ...<br><br>
        Whilst I concede that I currently lack work experience in my newly-chosen field, my
        background demonstrates a solid work ethic. Prior positions have taught me teamwork,
        Customer relations and to have a proactive approach to overcoming challenges as they arise.
        I have worked in both autonomous and collaborative roles and can communicate easily and
        effectively with people at all levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical thinking and problem-solving were a constant factor in working as a Fleet
        Controller, but these skills have been fine-tuned even further by my studies. The process of
        error-resolution in the course of developing applications and programs has taught me that -
        sometimes - re-designing the initial approach can lead to a better end-result.

                In April, 1994, my time in local transport commenced when I started as a courier
                driver for Skippers Transport. Like most drivers I was an owner-operator, delivering
                urgent parcels, envelopes, packages and more. As an owner-driver, I was responsible
                for maintaining good client relations, my own run-sheets, log-books and tax records.

                Having operated as a de-facto stand-in two-way operator for some time, in October of
                1996 I took on a role as the AM Despatcher whilst with Skippers Transport. In this
                capacity, I would log-in drivers as they commenced for the day, and operated as
                bookings clerk and dispatcher until the full-time staff started work.

            Completed at the end of 2020, Clive ... of the Dead was my first assessment using the
            Unity package. Clive was a 2D scrolling platformer. Coding for the game was written in
            C#. In the game, our hero must deal with swooping bats that will awaken when he moves
            beneath them, and then continuously attack until Clive can run/jump far enough away to
            evade their sonar.

            In addition to the bats, Clive had to contend with spiders and rats whilst trying to
            collect as much treasure as he can before making good his escape. The game has a few
            'Easter Eggs' in the form of humourous head-stones which could be discovered for extra
            points.

            entirely in C#, with local database storage. Recipe Book allows users to store and
            retrieve recipes, as well as creating and editting new ones. Personal favourites could
            be marked with a 'Faves' star, which could be accessed through a menu system.

            This project took up a considerable amount of my study-time early in 2021. I had a
            vision of how I wanted the app to look and perform; trying to match this goal led to
            numerous late night/early morning coding sessions, and even had me reaching-out to
            SyncFusion(USA) for assistance.

            The Life & Boats of CaptainSteve was my first web-site to be hosted live. We learned
            about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and how to connect with Google to interface with
            actual web-users. Fuelled by my recently discovered interest in JavaScript, I created a
            somewhat unique landing page for this site.

            In addition to the JavaScript code, CaptainSteve was written using HTML, CSS and PHP.

            The site was first launched in 2022.

            Anagrams was an assessment from my 2023 unit on Data Analytics and Power BI. This
            assignment continued my introduction to Python packages such as numpy and pandas. My
            submission began by indexing a dictionary file containing more than 200,000 entries. The
            user would be prompted to enter a word and the application would search to see if the
            word was present. Additionally, the programme would also search a pre-indexed dataframe
            to list any and all anagrams of the user's word.

            My Video Player app was built as an assessment for the Advanced Python programming class
            in 2023. The remit was to construct an app that could search a local file system for
            image and video files, and then display and play these. The project was written in
            Python using the PyQt5 library.

            During the first semester we had been formed into teams and allocated projects which
            were to be a large part of our final assessments. Initially, my team was assigned the
            PLUMS project and I spent a considerable portion of my 2021/ 2022 break working on the
            Laravel database section. However, I was later re-assigned to another project as our
            class size had suffered considerably due to attrition.
