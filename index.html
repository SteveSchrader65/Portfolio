          <p>Welcome to my digital workspace !! </p>
          <p>It is my hope that this portfolio serves to demonstrate my developing capabilities across modern web technologies; from clean front-end implementations to robust database solutions.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Since its inception in 2021, this platform has evolved from a simple list of links placed against an image backdrop, into the fully-fledged portfolio site you are seeing today.</p>
          <ul class="mt-4 -mb-6 ml-8">
            <li>2021 - Development began with a minimalist landing page housing academic assessment links</li>
            <!-- Today, that landing page exists in the form of the Links drop-down in the top-right corner -->
            <li>2022 - First major redesign transformed the site into an organized hub for TAFE projects</li>
            <li>2024 - Second iteration established the core architecture you see today, setting up for scalable growth</li>
            <li>2025 - Third iteration embraced modern web practices with TailwindCSS integration, refined animations, and enhanced interactivity</li>
            <li>Future - Planned rebuild in React will further optimize performance and expand functionality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As it has developed, sections and features were added until the design became its' present form.
          <br>You can:</p>
          <ul class="mb-4 ml-8">
            <li>Explore my Diploma Wall and academic achievements in the Studies section</li>
            <li>Discover featured Projects showcasing key skills developed during my studies</li>
            <li>Review my professional journey through the Employment timeline</li>
            <li>Connect with me through the Contact section</li>
            <li>(For the adventurous: try the 'Launch Control' feature!)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of these are custom-built interactive features written in JavaScript !!</p>
          <br>

          <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my online portfolio, where innovation meets practical experience in web development and programming. I am excited to showcase the skills and projects that I have developed since making the life-changing decision to return to full-time studies.</p>
          <p>In 2019 - after two decades in the transport industry - I reached a pivotal moment and chose to pursue a long-held passion for IT and programming; an interest that had been with me since my teen years.</p>
          <p>This transitional journey culminated in Diplomas of Advanced Programming (2023) and Front-End Web Development (2024), and has allowed me to combine my prior professional experience with cutting-edge technical skills.</p>
          <p>Throughout, I have worked to develop my knowledge in numerous programming languages and frameworks, with a particular enthusiasm for JavaScript and its modern frameworks. I've also gained valuable experience working directly with clients, gathering requirements, and
            implementing solutions based on user feedback. My involvement in team projects has honed my abilities in project planning, UI development, and collaborative problem-solving.</p>
          <p>Since completing formal studies, I continue to expand my skill-set through tutorials and online courses, delving into frameworks such as NodeJS and ThreeJS. From crafting responsive websites to developing mobile applications and complex database solutions, my work demonstrates
            both technical versatility and a commitment to continuous learning.</p>
          <p>I trust that the projects showcased here reflect my practical approach to problem-solving, my ability to adapt to diverse technical challenges, and my dedication to creating efficient, user-focused solutions.</p>

            After two decades in the transport industry, I made a deliberate choice to pursue my passion for
            technology and restart my career in Programming and Web Development.

            communication skills through interactions with clients and colleagues at all organizational
            levels, and I bring a proven track record of reliability and professionalism.
