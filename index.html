        <p>Originally created in 2021 as a platform for academic projects, this site has evolved alongside my web development journey.</p>
        <p>Over the summer of 2023/24, the platform was re-built to showcase my work and projects to potential employers and clients.</p>
        <p>At the end of 2024, having completed studies, I looked to apply learned lessons by re-examing my UI.</p>
        <p>From foundational web technologies to advanced frameworks such as NextJS and NodeJS, each section reflects my commitment
          to continuous learning and professional growth. As I explore new technologies to expand my skillset, this
          portfolio serves as both a testament to my journey and a dynamic showcase of my web developer projects.</p>
        <p>This portfolio aims to demonstrate my growing expertise in modern web technologies, featuring projects that highlight my
          skills in front-end development, programming, and database management. Through my work and studies, I have worked to develop
          proficiency in creating practical, user-centered solutions.</p>
        <p>(My current plan is to re-do this site in React, once I gain more proficiency with that JavaScript framework - in its' present
          state, the site uses vanilla JS to perform DOM manipulation for the animations.)</p>

          Hi !! I'm <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Just a little JS wizardry"><span id="animateMe"></span></span>
        </p>
        <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my online portfolio, where innovation meets practical experience in web development and programming. I am excited to showcase the skills and projects that I have developed since making the life-changing decision to return to full-time studies.</p>

This transition has allowed me to combine my extensive professional experience with cutting-edge technical skills.</p>
        <p>Throughout this journey, I have worked to develop my knowledge in numerous programming languages and frameworks, with a particular enthusiasm for JavaScript and its modern frameworks. I've also gained valuable experience working directly with clients, gathering requirements, and
          implementing solutions based on user feedback. My involvement in team projects has honed my abilities in project planning, UI development, and collaborative problem-solving.</p>
        <p>Since completing formal studies, I continue to expand my skill-set through tutorials and online courses, delving into frameworks such as ExpressJS and ThreeJS. From crafting responsive websites to developing mobile applications and complex database solutions, my work demonstrates
          both technical versatility and a commitment to continuous learning.</p>
        <p>I trust that the projects showcased here reflect my practical approach to problem-solving, my ability to adapt to diverse technical challenges, and my dedication to creating efficient, user-focused solutions.</p>

          Whilst I am new to the tech industry, my extensive professional background has equipped me with
          valuable transferable skills. Years of managing complex logistics and customer relationships
          have honed my ability to work both independently and as part of a team. I've developed strong
          communication skills through daily interactions with clients and colleagues at all organizational
          levels, and I bring a proven track record of reliability and professionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critical thinking and problem-solving were a constant factor in working as a Fleet
          Controller - these skills that have been further refined through my technical studies.
          The challenges of software development have taught me to approach problems methodically,
          often finding that the willingness to step back and re-evaluate leads to more elegant
          solutions. This combination of professional experience and technical training has prepared me to contribute effectively in a development role.

                  In April, 1994, my time in local transport commenced when I started as a courier
                  driver for Skippers Transport. Like most drivers I was an owner-operator, delivering
                  urgent parcels, envelopes, packages and more. As an owner-driver, I was responsible
                  for maintaining good client relations, my own run-sheets, log-books and tax records.

                  1996 I took on a role as the AM Despatcher whilst with Skippers Transport. In this
                  capacity, I would log-in drivers as they commenced for the day, and operated as
                  bookings clerk and dispatcher until the full-time staff started work.
