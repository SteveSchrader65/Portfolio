        <p>Originally created in 2021 as a platform for academic projects, this site has evolved alongside my web development journey.</p>
        <p>Over the summer of 2023/24, the platform was re-built to showcase my work and projects to potential employers and clients.</p>
        <p>At the end of 2024, having completed studies, I looked to apply learned lessons by re-examing my UI.</p>
        <p>(My current plan is to re-do this site in React, once I gain more proficiency with that JavaScript framework)</p>
        <p>From foundational web technologies to advanced frameworks such as NextJS and NodeJS, each section reflects my commitment
          to continuous learning and professional growth. As I continue to explore new technologies and expand my skillset, this
          portfolio serves as both a testament to my journey and a dynamic showcase of my web developer projects.</p>

        <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my online portfolio, where innovation meets practical experience in web development and programming. I am excited to showcase the skills and projects that I have developed since making the life-changing decision to return to full-time studies.</p>
        <p>After two decades in the transport industry, I reached a pivotal moment and chose to pursue a long-held passion for IT and programming - an interest sparked in my teenage years.</p>
        <p>Thus, in 2019 I took the bold step of returning to studies, culminating in Diplomas of Advanced Programming (2023) and Front-End Web Development (2024).</p>
        <p>Throughout this journey, I have worked to develop expertise in numerous programming languages and frameworks, with a particular enthusiasm for JavaScript and its modern frameworks.</p>
        <p>Since completing formal studies, I continue to expand my skill-set with tutorials and online courses into other frameworks, such as ExpressJs and ThreeJS. From crafting responsive
          websites to developing mobile applications and complex database solutions, my portfolio demonstrates both technical versatility and a commitment to continuous learning.</p>
        <p>I trust that the projects showcased here reflect my practical approach to problem-solving and my ability to adapt to diverse technical challenges.</p>

                Completed at the end of 2020, Clive ... of the Dead was my first assessment using the
                Unity package. Clive was a 2D scrolling platformer. Coding for the game was written in
                C#. In the game, our hero must deal with swooping bats that will awaken when he moves
                beneath them, and then continuously attack until Clive can run/jump far enough away to
                evade their sonar.

              <p>
                In addition to the bats, Clive had to contend with spiders and rats whilst trying to
                collect as much treasure as he can before making good his escape. The game has a few
                'Easter Eggs' in the form of humourous head-stones which could be discovered for extra
                points.

                The Recipe Book app was assigned early in 2021. This database application was written
                entirely in C#, with local database storage. Recipe Book allows users to store and
                retrieve recipes, as well as creating and editting new ones. Personal favourites could
                be marked with a 'Faves' star, which could be accessed through a menu system.

                This project took up a considerable amount of my study-time early in 2021. I had a
                vision of how I wanted the app to look and perform; trying to match this goal led to
                numerous late night/early morning coding sessions, and even had me reaching-out to
                SyncFusion(USA) for assistance.

                The Life & Boats of CaptainSteve was my first web-site to be hosted live. We learned
                about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and how to connect with Google to interface with
                actual web-users. Fuelled by my recently discovered interest in JavaScript, I created a
                somewhat unique landing page for this site.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the JavaScript code, CaptainSteve was written using HTML, CSS and PHP.

                Anagrams was an assessment from my 2023 unit on Data Analytics and Power BI. This
                assignment continued my introduction to Python packages such as numpy and pandas. My
                submission began by indexing a dictionary file containing more than 200,000 entries. The
                user would be prompted to enter a word and the application would search to see if the
                word was present. Additionally, the programme would also search a pre-indexed dataframe
                to list any and all anagrams of the user's word.

                My Video Player app was built as an assessment for the Advanced Python programming class
                in 2023. The remit was to construct an app that could search a local file system for
                image and video files, and then display and play these. The project was written in
                Python using the PyQt5 library.

                During the first semester we had been formed into teams and allocated projects which
                were to be a large part of our final assessments. Initially, my team was assigned the
                PLUMS project and I spent a considerable portion of my 2021/ 2022 break working on the
                Laravel database section. However, I was later re-assigned to another project as our
                class size had suffered considerably due to attrition.

          <p>
            Whilst I concede that I currently lack work experience in my newly-chosen field, my
            background demonstrates a solid work ethic. Prior positions have taught me teamwork,
            Customer relations and to have a proactive approach to overcoming challenges as they arise.
            I have worked in both autonomous and collaborative roles and can communicate easily and
            effectively with people at all levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Critical thinking and problem-solving were a constant factor in working as a Fleet
            Controller, but these skills have been fine-tuned even further by my studies. The process of
            error-resolution in the course of developing applications and programs has taught me that -
            sometimes - re-designing the initial approach can lead to a better end-result.
