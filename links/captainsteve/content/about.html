		<h2>CaptainSteve &#45; an modelling biographic</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this web-site &#45; quite apart from being a required assessment for various units of 
			my Web Development course &#45; is to showcase the models I have built over the past 20 years or so.
		</p>
		<p>For, Dear Visitor, many years ago I discovered a passion for the mighty sailing vessels of yesteryear. The 
			majesty of the Spanish galleons, the economic force majeure of the VOC (Dutch East India Company) fleets 
			and the sheer power commanded by massive, multi-decked English Ships-of-the-Line spoke of a time gone by; 
			a time when the power of a kingdom, a royal House, or an empire was projected in the ships in which they 
			traversed the seas.
		</p>
		<p>In my youth &#45; like many young lads &#45; I had dabbled with plastic models; mostly planes, tanks and other 
			military hardware. But, alas, life soon took over, and childhood pursuits were forced to give way to 
			reality. But one fateful day I found myself in a store which, among other things, sold model kits &#45; and 
			spied something which were to immediately give purpose to almost every spare moment over the next 20 years.
		</p>	
		<p>And so, after handing over a fistful of dollars, I went home that day with my first all-wooden model ship kit &#45; 
			completely clueless as to what I had just gotten myself into. As I soon found out, these kits were nothing 
			like the plastic model kits of younger days. Those kits had come with pre-made parts which just had 
			to be glued together.
		</p>
		<img class="home right" src="images/Intro/intro1.jpg" title="Opening the box" alt="Display contents of the kit box">
		<p>But inside this box were bundles of un-shaped wood strips; cloth from which sails were to be cut; packets of 
			extremely small pieces of which I had no idea of their purpose; and yards upon yards of variously-coloured 
			threads which were to become the rigging &#45; plus pages and pages of highly-detailed plans.
		</p>				
		<img class="home left" src="images/Intro/intro2.jpg" title="Bend It" alt="Using a curling iron to shape wood strips">
		<p>I learned a lot from that first kit. One of the earliest lessons was how to bend the strips of wood to form 
			the planking around the hull. Of course, the instructions did not explain how this was to be accomplished. 
		</p>	
		<p>At first, I tried steaming them, then soaking them in boiling water for hours before trying to gently force 
			them into position. Eventually, I were to &#34;borrow&#34; a hair-curling iron and found this to be my preferred 
			method.
		</p>
		<img class="home right" src="images/Intro/intro3.jpg" title="First planking" alt="Laying the foundation planking">
		<p>Constructed during the evenings and weekends, that first kit ended-up taking almost five years to complete. 
			But having been bitten by the modelling bug, I was quick to purchase a second kit. That one went a little 
			quicker, requiring just a mere three years to build.
		</p>
		<p>Some time after that second kit was completed I was to find an online forum which has become my internet 
			&#34;home&#34; for most of the past ten years &#45; and, indeed, the only social media platform of which I have ever 
			been a member. I had actually purchased a third kit at this point and, after doing some research into the 
			history of that ship, I discovered ModelShipWorld (see right).
		</p>
		<p>Here was collected some of the best ship-modellers across the globe ... and they were more than happy to 
			answer all of the questions I was to ask.  
		</p>
		<img class="home left" src="images/Intro/intro4.jpg" title="Second planking" alt="Laying of decorative planking">
		<p>Unfortunately, after a number of false-starts, that third kit was eventually to be consigned to the dust-bin, 
			however, it was quickly replaced with another. Following an alcohol-induced Saturday afternoon discussion 
			with a friend of mine, I soon found myself purchasing another kit ... and being a new member of MSW, began 
			writing my first online blog to document that build.
		</p>
		<p>And, Dear Reader, it was around this time that the on-line persona of CaptainSteve first came to be. Over 
			the course of his next two builds &#45; which you can view on the following pages of this web-site &#45; CaptainSteve 
			developed his method of writing into a mash-up of invented words, modern and Elizabethan English, as well 
			as a mixture of first-, second- and third-person speech that wouldst very often change context mid-sentence.
		</p>
		<p>At time of this writing, CaptainSteve doth currently have a fifth ship on his work-bench &#45; the bomb-vessel, 
			HMS Granado. This, however, has remained untouched for the past few years as his studies have taken precedence; 
			plans for yet another ship-modelling project also exist with the intention to build all three of Christopher 
			Columbus&#39; ships: the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. </p>
		<p>But more on these matters another time ...</p>

		<p>(Visit MSW today - link above)</p>
		<p>ModelShipWorld, known to its&#39; members as MSW, is the premier site catering to those with an interest in modelling 
			sailing vessels of all types. There are other sites with similar content, of course, but with an international 
			membership base of over 30,000 MSW is far and away the flagship site.
		</p>
		<p>MSW has hundreds of user-generated forums wherein topics of interest are posted regarding maritime matters, or 
			questions regarding a particular model, artistic and historical matters, or technical concepts which may help 
			other modellers with their builds. And just like other online portals built around their users, there are also 
			humourous forums for those down-times between models or blog-posts ... although, as you can imagine, the vast 
			majority of the humourous posts on MSW are maritime related.
			... it's sort of like a StackOverflow, but for those with a maritime bent.	 
		</p>
		<img class="home left" src="images/Intro/intro5.jpg" title="Kit Bashing" alt="Montage showing a deviation from plans">
		<p>Indeed, CaptainSteve didst starteth an forum his ownself some years back; the purpose of which was to identify ways 
			in which common and everyday items could be somehow fashioned into ship-modelling parts. One example, as posted 
			by a renowned professional modeller, was to use common blackboard chalk for details such as figure-heads and 
			statues ... it is a far more forgiving medium than trying to carve these in wood !! And Our Hero did also 
			post numerous ideas, among these was the use of poppy-seeds to mimic bolt-heads (see montage).
		</p>
		<img class="home right" src="images/Intro/intro6.jpg" title="Planking" alt="Laying of outer planking over foundation planking">
		<p>But undoubtably the most interesting feature of MSW is the build-logs which its&#39; members create to document the 
			work done on their models. These ships &#45; as CaptainSteve will attest &#45; can take years to complete. Additionally, 
			having a forum where others can follow, comment and assist with the many, many problems encountered during the 
			course of the build is absolutely invaluable. Plus, if you've an interest in matters historical and maritime ... 
			or just like looking at the pictures (we refer to them as &#34;eye-candy&#34;) then the blogs are always a fantastic 
			source of entertainment. 
		</p>

			free (though donations are accepted) ... you will not be asked for your credit card details upon signing-up.
