		<h2>Apostol Felipe</h2>
		<p>The Ap√≥stol Felipe was one of six galleons built by ship-wright, Martin de Arana, for King Philip IV of Spain sometime circa 
			1625AD.

		<p class="textLeft">de Arana personally financed construction of the fleet:&#45; this practice may seem strange to modern ears; 
			however, historians now believe this to have been common practice by Spanish royal Houses (and others) of the era &#45; most 
			certainly it earned the benefactors substantial royal favours.

			These ships belonged to the treasure fleet known as the Silver Galleons ("Galeones de la Plata"), used to transport 
			goods and treasures on the route between America and Spain, the so-called Race for the Indies, following the Spanish 
			conquest of the native Aztecs by Hernan Cortez.

		<img class="ship right" src="images/Ships/Apostol/Apostol4.jpg" title="Astern View" alt="Apostol Felipe stern view">
		<p class="textLeft">Apostol Felipe was launched late in 1628, and began her initial voyage as part of the treasure fleet in 1629. 
			At that time, she transported gold and precious gems back to Spain.

		<p class="textLeft">Until 1633 she was the lead admirality ship of the Armada de la Guardia.
			<br><br>Later, the Apostol Felipe took part in the war to retake Pernambuco (Brazil), and also carried troops and cash to Flanders 
			for the Battle of the Dunes on June 14, 1658.

		<p class="textRight">This model was built from a kit produced by Occre. This was yet another spur-of-the-moment, "must-have" purchase 
			by CaptainSteve. She took almost three years to complete, being finished in late 2012.

		<img class="ship left" src="images/Ships/Apostol/Apostol7.jpg" title="Starboard Galleries" alt="Apostol Felipe starboard rear galleries">    
		<p class="textLeft">The kit comes with high regard from Our Hero and is supplied complete with a large number of cast-metal details, 
			such as gun-port framings, a figurehead, gallery arches and a large, stern lantern which &#45; with the aid of chemical-ageing 
			techniques &#45; give the model some some very pleasing highlights.

		<img class="ship right" src="images/Ships/Apostol/Apostol8.jpg" title="Bridge Close-up" alt="Apostol Felipe bridge close-up">
		<p class="textRight">By this stage, CaptainSteve was becoming quite the budding &#34;kit-basher&#34; (although, at the time, he didst not 
			know-eth of the term) and were to add other detailings of his own making; for example, in this build anti-boarding netting has been 
			added, and is visible hanging from the inter-deck bridge &#45; this was once common fly-screen netting which Our Hero was to 
			retrieve and re-purpose.</p>

		<p class="textLeft">Completed, this model stands almost 700mm high, is approx 800mm long from the fore flagstaff to the stern 
			galleries, and has a beam of 110mm.
