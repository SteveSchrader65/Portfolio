		<h2>Our Piracy Policy</h2>
		<p>At CaptainSteve Industries (collectively &#34;we&#34;, &#34;us&#34;, &#34;our&#34;, &#34;Our Hero&#34;, &#34;CaptainSteve&#34;), we take piracy and 
			security considerations seriously. We do not retain-eth yer personal data for the purposes of targetted 
			advertising, spamming, spoofing or on-selling to third-party data-collection agencies. This be primarily 
			because-eth:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They be-eth scum</li>
			<li>We don&#39;t know-eth any</li>
			<li>The form we ask-eth ye to complete be not connected to an database of any kind</li>
			<li>This page be-eth entirely intended as satire and entertainment</li>
			<li>Validation of yer personal information be-eth wholly and soley fer the purposes of satisfying course 
				assessment requirements of CaptainSteve&#39;s web-development course units</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<p>Providing yer personal information to CaptainSteve (inc) via our <a href="contact.php">Contact</a> page be-eth 
			most completely safe. We shall not-eth use yer data for any nefarious actions except-eth for:
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>High Treason</li>
				<li>Kidnapping</li>
				<li>Piracy on the High Seas</li>
				<li>Grand Theft Auto (ver III, IV and V)</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>Our Cookie Policy</h2>		
		<p>CaptainSteve doth prefer-eth short-breads. He doest, however, consider-eth Monte-Carlos, Tim-Tams or 
			&#45; indeed-eth &#45; any of the products produced by the Arnotts Biscuit Company to be an acceptable substitution. 
			(Except-eth for Water Crackers ... they be-eth too bland and do not appeal to CaptainSteve's exquisite taste-buds.)
			Currently this web-site does not use the other kind of "cookie" (the computer variety). We do, however, use a local 
            storage variable to retrieve the pirate name and port which you enter on our Contact page - this is used as a greeting
            for when you return. This variable is stored on yer own computer; we also use a session variable to track your ship on 
			the landing page. In the unlikely event that cookies are ever to be employed, CaptainSteve shall update this policy.
		</p>
		<h2>No Smoking Policy</h2>                
		<p>This web-site enforces a strict no-smoking policy. Please do not smoke whilst logged onto our site. Health authorities 
			have informed us that doing so may adversely affect the health of our employees, or that of other visitors to our site

			grade for this assessment.
